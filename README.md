# SakuraVIX

This is an animation which responds to fear. 

The VIX is a measure of stock market fear. The more fear out there, the fewer petals on the tree.

## Thoughts

This is made with [PaperJS](http://paperjs.org), which is convenient but it seems a bit slow when there are a lot of petals. 

## ToDo

+ Clean up code
+ Put a demo on codepen
